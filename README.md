**Overview of the Analysis**

This project provides analysis and visualization how the city type (rural, suburban, urban) is related to the time of year, and the amount of the fares collected to further assist the client to make decisions on where to focus to rectify the differences discerned.

 Urban
 
The urban cities had 1625 rides, the most of any of the three groups.  There were the most drivers (2405) with an average per ride of $24.53 and an average fare per driver of $16.57. It appears that not all drivers had rides during this period. Urban area trips would likely be shorter and have a higher demand overall due to the reduced availability of parking for personal transportation. The rides offer flexibility to riders in these areas to access the services in the area without exposure to crime risk, weather, or darkness. These services appear to be popular and needed in the urban areas.  Ridership was stable over all the months with small variation.  Spikes in fares may be due to some type of venue, ie, basketball games or theatre in more use at these times of year.  More persons per load with these large group events could increase revenue per ride (and offer more tip opportunity).


Suburban

 The 490 drivers completed 625 rides.  Average fare per ride was $30.97 and average fare per driver equalled $39.50. It appears that there was more opportunity for drivers to collect fare.  The decrease in rides in suburban areas is likely attributed to the higher availability of personal transportation.  However it appears that these trips were longer in duration increasing the average fare per ride to match the trip length. The driver's average fare appears to reward the efforts to transport persons requiring the ride service in these suburban areas.  Fares seemed to increase in late winter with cold weather and decreased when the weather improved.  When weather is inclement, suburbanites are utilizing these services to get to their job in the urban area to avoid automobile accidents or wear on their cars or perhaps they are taking longer rides to mass transit to escape the cold weather.
  
 Rural
 
Drivers in the rural area had less rides (125) for 78 drivers but the average fare per ride was higher than the suburban and urban areas and in turn the average fare per driver was higher.  This follows the likelihood that while there is less of a demand in number of rides, the rides are longer.  Persons in rural areas are the most likely to have personal transportation for local needs but would benefit from ride service to access urban and suburban services (ie, medical care) or mass transit options such as air travel or passenger train travel.  Fares were consistent during this time suggesting there is a need for this service consistently over time to take persons who prefer not to drive to more congested areas.  This is a true need for rural residents and offers them actually cheaper transportation to services and reduces the stress of driving themselves. 
 
  
**Summary** 

Three business recommendations based on the disparities among the city types include:
  1.  Urban rides are based more on quantity than distance.  Urban dwellers live at a "need it now" pace.  Increasing the quantity of rides could be accomplished with utilizing an app using incentives such as points or discounts on the nth ride would increase exisisting customer use.  Marketing with local hotels, venues, and retail outlets with referral perks would also increase ridership without an expensive marketing effort.
  2.  Suburban riders appear to utilize the transport a little more seasonally.  Again the app to call the drivers may be able to pick up their location and offer more incentives for riders to use the service more often with point incentives.  Marketing and development of this segment may be more intense since these riders are more scattered out and could possibly need targeted advertisement in other popular apps.  This seems to be a stable market though for the use and fare amounts so there is a win-win for the market.
  3.  Rural riders will utilize the service the more they see the benefit of not getting in their car or pick up to drive in to the city. If the drivers reside in the rural areas they have more access to the grass roots and can be rewarded with bonus if they increase the number of trips.  Another inexpensive marketing approach would be to visit with the local healthcare providers and let them know the service would be valuable for those needing medical visits.  Working with the local town leadership can also generate a buzz locally.  This group doesn't pay a great deal of attention to much mass media except for the local radio station which may offer relatively cheap advertising opportunities.
